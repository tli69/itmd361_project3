	<h2>Club History</h2>
	<p>Chelsea was founded in 1905 by businessman Gus Mears. The club's early years were characterized by financial struggles, but they managed to win their first major trophy, the Football League Championship, in 1955. In the 1960s, Chelsea became a major force in English football, winning the FA Cup in 1965 and the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup in 1971.</p>
	<p>Chelsea's fortunes fluctuated in the following decades, with periods of success and failure. However, the arrival of Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich as the club's owner in 2003 changed the club's trajectory, as he invested heavily in the squad and infrastructure. Chelsea won their first Premier League title in 2005, and have since won four more. They have also won the FA Cup eight times, the League Cup five times, and the UEFA Champions League twice.</p>

	<p>Stamford Bridge has been Chelsea's home since the club's formation in 1905. The stadium has a capacity of just over 40,000, and has undergone several renovations and expansions over the years. In recent years, there have been discussions about building a new stadium to increase capacity and modernize the facilities, but no concrete plans have been announced yet.</p>
